# Greenfield OpenStack Workshop

## Context

### OpenStack and Greenfield

> [OpenStack is a cloud operating system](https://www.openstack.org/software/) that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed through a dashboard that gives administrators control while empowering their users to provision resources through a web interface.

### Infrastructure As Code

## Technical Setup

You will be interacting with the Greenfield OpenStack in two ways: the web dashboard and the commandline interface.

- The _Greenfield Web Dashboard_ is a convenient way to view and manage your OpenStack setup.

- The _Greenfield commandline interface_ is better suited for an interface-as-code way of interacting. For instance by issuing a command to load pre-defined configuration templates from a file, or to invoke specific commands to bring up an instance, etc.

# Hands-on Time

After this introduction, it's up to you to get your hands dirty. We propose you start with the most simple task of creating a single CentOS7 server that you can log into with SSH.
